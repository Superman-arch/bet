# Git Setup Instructions

## ✅ Fixed Issues
- Git user email configured
- Git user name configured  
- Initial commit created with all files

## 📤 Next Steps to Push Your Code

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository
1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Name it "bet" (or your preferred name)
3. Keep it private if desired
4. **DON'T** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Add Remote and Push
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add your remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bet.git

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Alternative: Using GitHub CLI
If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
# Create repo and push in one command
gh repo create bet --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## 🔐 Authentication Options

### Option 1: HTTPS with Personal Access Token
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate a new token with "repo" scope
3. Use the token as your password when pushing

### Option 2: SSH
```bash
# Check if you have SSH keys
ls ~/.ssh/id_*.pub

# If not, generate one
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Add to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copy output and add to GitHub Settings → SSH keys

# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/bet.git
```

## 📊 Current Repository Status
- ✅ Git initialized
- ✅ All files committed
- ✅ Working tree clean
- ❌ No remote configured yet

## 🚀 Quick Commands Reference
```bash
# View current status
git status

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# View remotes
git remote -v

# Push to remote (after adding it)
git push -u origin main
```

## 💡 Tips
- The `-u` flag in `git push -u origin main` sets up tracking
- After the first push, you can just use `git push`
- Keep your Git credentials secure
- Consider using GitHub's built-in security features like branch protection

Your code is ready to push! Just create the remote repository and follow the steps above.
